BUGS:

1. Blank house number field breaks new listening page
2. Server sync inconsistent
3. Tags not filtering (specifically when recording listening)
4. Tags not showing in lists
5. Edit questionnaires to add/remove/edit questions (not really a bug?)

SPRINT THE SECOND:

1. Capture personal information into its own table and link to interview
2. Add area field, change 'rough location' to 'road' and have roads belong to areas
3. Stats page, select area, road (or all) and tags (or all?) with some options an that. Display chart (chart.js?) make it look gud.

----- cap here after 4 days!

4. User roles (view only, record and review, review with personal details, admin)
5. Annotate completed interviews. Text field for general input and an extra tag field for follow-up.
