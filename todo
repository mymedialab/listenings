SPRINT THE SECOND:

2. Add area field, change 'rough location' to 'road' and have roads belong to areas
  - FOR RELEASE:
    Apply migrations (this will add areas, locations and location_id to the Interview model)
    Run artisan command to migrate current locations. This will convert existing locations to locations in the 'Bodmin' area and link them to the interviews.
    AFTERWARDS:
    create a migration to remove (or rename?) the location column from interviews. It's now defunct and only likely to clash with the location associations

1. Capture personal information into its own table and link to interview
3. Stats page, select area, road (or all) and tags (or all?) with some options an that. Display chart (chart.js?) make it look gud.

----- cap here after 4 days!

4. User roles (view only, record and review, review with personal details, admin)
5. Annotate completed interviews. Text field for general input and an extra tag field for follow-up.

PREVIOUSLY:

For fetches, setup a short timeout. (For put's  / post's just let it keep trying)
Nav menu as per easterschool
Change password / recover password
Also; add people as another (searchable, linked) entity.
